# Number-Guessing-Game

This is my soulation to the Number guessing game in python. 
Form road.map (https://roadmap.sh/projects/number-guessing-game)

I had trouble when it come to telling the user if it was higher or lower
Inital I want to make a branch of saying yes or no by hard coding in 50, 25, 12.5 so on and so forth and when I did yeah
It wasn't going great so I ask chatgpt and I still get it nor did I understand, but after looking at the soultion of other it click in my head
Then it dead out since I was making it more complicated than it was, and so I made it simple if I don't need to hard code it just tell the user base on the user input if he is higher or lower
Then I debugged in pycharm and figured out that my less than or greather than where wrong
and finally I finish the problem.

Is it pretty to me yeah it make sense
Is there safety rail grauds nope, is this acceptable to publish to code jesus yeah
